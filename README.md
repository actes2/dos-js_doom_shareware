# dos-js_doom_shareware
This repository exists to provide a very minimal setup for Doom running in the browser.

Because we leverage the direct 1996 shareware port of DOOM this is completely legal and usable in any context.

I don't believe it can load custom WAD's but you're more than welcome to try, you can modify the auto-config const in the index.html for your own parameters.

## How do I run it?

Clone the repository somewhere and navigate to the root of the repository.

If you have python installed you can simply run:
`python -m http.server 8000`

Then you can navigate to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
